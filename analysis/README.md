# Analysis

This repository provides the replication code for generating the figures corresponding to `Analysis 1 - 4` presented in the main text of the paper. It also includes additional scripts to reproduce the figures and results reported in the `SI Appendix`. The code covers model execution and figure generation, enabling full reproducibility of the paper's visual and analytical outputs.

Each analysis focuses on a distinct aspect of lobbying behavior and its relationship with bill characteristics, firm-level attributes, and industry-level patterns. Together, they offer a comprehensive view of how interest groups engage with the legislative process.
